# ChimpBNA Source Data

The source data for producing the figures in manuscript "Comparative Analysis of Human-Chimpanzee Divergence in Brain Connectivity and its Genetic Correlates"

## File description
Figure2: folder containing GIFTI files for visualization of ChimpBNA cortical subregions

Figure3: folder containing GIFTI files for producing chimp-human surface expansion maps, and chimp-human connectivity divergence maps

Figure4: folder containing GIFTI files for producing chimp/human asymmetric conectivity maps

Figure5: folder containing data for genetic analysis, including AHBA regional gene expression matrix

FigureS2: folder containing NIFTI files for visualization of ChimpBNA subregions

FigureS5-30: folder containing data for validation indices for ChimpBNA parcellation

FigureS31: folder containing data of structural connectome of ChimpBNA subregions. Note that the 244x244 matrix was ordered in left-cortex, right-cortex, left-subcortex, right subcortex, which is consistent with the label scheme in ChimpBNA

FigureS32: folder containing data of structural asymmetry values of ChimpBNA subregions in gray matter volume and surface area, the significant t-value and p-value were presented bold

FigureS34: folder containing GIFTI files for producing human-chimp connectivity divergence maps

FigureS35: folder containing data for connectivity divergence between humans and chimps for several example subregions

FigureS36: folder containing data for analyzing connectivity divergence value in functional networks and GIFTI file of functional network in HumanBNA

FigureS37: folder containing data for connectivity divergence between humans and chimps for several example subregions

FigureS38: folder containing data for connectional asymmetry for several example subregions

FigureS39: folder containing data for differential expressed analysis for identified genes in Psychencode database, including their gene names, expression values, fold changes, and statistical significance p-values which were presented bold
